# 📺 IMDb TV Show Analysis

Analyzed IMDb TV show data to explore how audience engagement (number of votes) and ratings correlate with viewership interest. This project focuses on identifying what factors influence a show's popularity and how user behavior impacts IMDb ratings.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This exploratory data analysis (EDA) project uses IMDb television data to investigate:

- Whether higher-rated shows receive more votes  
- How rating distributions vary across shows  
- Whether the number of votes influences rating outcomes  
- What characteristics define popular or highly engaged shows  

The goal is to uncover patterns in audience sentiment and engagement that can help streaming platforms or production studios identify strong-performing content.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The dataset required the following preprocessing steps:

- Removal of null values in rating and vote fields  
- Type conversions for numeric fields  
- Filtering out extreme outliers (e.g., shows with unusually large vote counts)  
- Standardizing column names for easier analysis
